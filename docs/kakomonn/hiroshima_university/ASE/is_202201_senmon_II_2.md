### (2)
([Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm))

Step 1: Determine an arbitrary vertex as the starting vertex of the MST.

Step 2: Follow steps 3 to 5 till there are vertices that are not included in the MST (known as fringe vertex).

Step 3: Find edges connecting any tree vertex with the fringe vertices.

Step 4: Find the minimum among these edges.

Step 5: Add the chosen edge to the MST if it does not form any cycle.

Step 6: Return the MST and exit

### (3)
Let $V$, $E$, $w$ denote the vertex set, the edge set and edge weights of $G$.

It is trivial that the subgraph obtained by Prim's algorithm is a tree. Let $T$ denote the subgraph.

Let $T^*$ denote a minimum spanning tree of graph $G$. If $T^* = T$, then $T$ is a minimum spanning tree.
Otherwise, let $e$ be the first edge added during the construction of tree $T$ that is not in tree $T^*$, and $V'$ be the set of vertices connected by the edges added before edge $e$.
Then one endpoint of $e$ is in set $V'$ and the other is not.
Since $T^*$ is connected, there exists an edge $f \neq e \in T^*$ such that one endpoint of $f$ is in set $V'$ and the other is not.
Hence at the iteration when edge $e$ was added to $T$, edge $f$ is also one of alternatives.
Since edge $f$ was not chosen, we know that

$$
w(f) \geq w(e)
$$

Let $T_1 = T^* \setminus \{f\} + \{e\}$.
Since $w(T_1) = w(T^*) - w(f) + w(e) \leq w(T^*)$, $T_1$ is also a minimum spanning tree which contains edge $e$ and all the edges added before it during the construction of set $V'$.
Repeat the steps above and we will eventually obtain a minimum spanning tree of graph $G$ that is identical to tree $T$, which shows that $T$ is a minimum spanning tree.

### (4)
If we use an adjacent list graph representation and a binary heap to find an edge of minimum weight, then the worst-case time complexity is $O(|E| \log |E|) = O(|E| \log |V|)$

### (5)
Assume the contrary, that there are two different MSTs $A$ and $B$.

Since $A \neq B$, there is at least one edge that belongs to one but not the other.
Among such edges, let $e_1$ be the one with least weight; this choice is unique because the edge weights are all distinct.
W.l.o.g, assume $e_1 \in A$.

As $B$ is an MST, $\{e_1\} \cup B$ must contain a cycle $C$ with $e_1$.
As a tree, $A$ contains no cycles, therefore $C$ must have an edge $e_2$ that is not in $A$.
Since $e_1$ was chosen as the unique lowest-weight edge among those belonging to exactly one of $A$ and $B$, the weight of $e_2$ must be greater than the weight of $e_1$.
As $e_1$ and $e_2$ are part of the cycle $C$, replacing $e_2$ with $e_1$ in $B$ therefore yields a spanning tree with a smaller weight, which contradicts the assumption that $B$ is an MST.
